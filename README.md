# NLP Restaurant Search Engine (WORK IN PROGRESS)
## Objective
Search engines are everywhere such as in e-commerce, social media, education, and general sites and they are frequently used daily by almost everyone around the world. Although restaurant search engines aren't unique and exist already in Yelp and other business review sites; I always wondered how search engines are built and processed. This project is my take on populating accurate restaurant listings using multiple datasets through natural language processing which I aim to provide specific results based on user’s search input whether it’s general search term (i.e. ‘I want Chinese food’ ) or more specific (i.e. ‘guacamole with picadillo).

## Target Audience
The project is geared towards food enthusiasts and travelers looking for specific taste and atmosphere, however it can be also useful for the general population looking for places to dine or take-out. 

## Dataset
In this project, I am using multiple datasets relating to restaurants, food/ingredients, and menu items. Yelp's dataset is used for getting businesses, reviews, and tips datasets which contain a wealth of restaurants’ text information. Yummly's dataset is used for referencing each cuisine’s ingredient list. Lastly, I web-scraped restaurant menu data from Allmenus, which contains valuable food/drink menu information. Below are the summary for each datasets:

**Yelp Dataset**
- 8,021,122 reviews 
- 209,393 businesses
- 1,320,710 tips
- Over 1.4 million business attributes.

**Yummly Dataset**
- 20 cuisines (Korean, Spanish, etc.)
- 36,568 ingredients

**Allmenus**
- 12,000+ restaurants
- 1,000,000+ menus 

## Approach (More Details TBA)
- NLP Spacy, sklearn, LDA modeling, etc.

## Deliverables
Associated code, paper, and powerpoint presentation.
